# C++ Practice Set

Welcome to my C++ Practice Set repository! ðŸš€  
This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that I wrote while practicing and learning core programming concepts.  
You'll find simple exercises, basic problems, and solutions that helped strengthen my fundamentals in C++.


## About

- **Language:** C++
- **Purpose:** Practice and strengthen programming skills
- **Content:** Individual `.cpp` files with various basic problems
- **Status:** Ongoing - more files will be added as I continue learning!


## Setting Up Your PC for C++ Development

Follow these steps to set up your system for running C++ programs:

### 1. Install a C++ Compiler

- **Windows:** Install [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), or [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- **Mac:** Install Command Line Tools by running:
  ```sh
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- **Linux: Install g++ using:
  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install g++
  ```
### 2. Install an IDE or Code Editor
You can use any code editor you prefer. Recommended options:

- Visual Studio Code
- CLion
- Code::Blocks
- Dev-C++
  
### 3. Compile and Run a Program
Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing your .cpp file.

To compile:
```sh
g++ filename.cpp -o outputname
```
To run:
```sh
./outputname
```
Example:
```sh
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
```
## Folder Structure

- Each .cpp file corresponds to a separate problem or concept.
- No complex directory structure, it's simple and easy to browse!
